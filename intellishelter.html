			<h2><u> Process </u></h2>
			<p>
				I made Intellishelter with the help of a team for my Human-Computer Interaction class.
				This project was made partially in response to the severe hurricanes in Houston and Florida;
				my group and I realized that necessary information about shelters, like the capacity, handicap accessibility, and regular alerts, should be consolidated into one app. We went through an interview process to figure out what the app should need, and afterwards, several rounds of iterative testing to refine the idea. I made much of the design decisions and coded the transportation pages and the manager log-in.<br><br>

				The app consists of two parts: the regular user trying to find information about a shelter, and the manager who is updating information to keep it current. To access the manager part of the app, the email is "shelter@shelter.gov", and
				the password is	"password." I recommend checking our work out.
