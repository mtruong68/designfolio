	<div class="centered text">SoundShot was conceptualized from the brevity of today's shared 
		media. Vines are consumed in 6 seconds; Tweets are the short form of prose, and Instagram, 
		Tumblr, and Snapchat are about endless streams of transitory images. A key media form is missing-
		audio. Of course, our society heavily emphasizes the visual, but I wondered what a short form of
		audio could be useful for. For people who want new music but don't want to listen to whole songs before 
		buying, shortened audio could be useful. Same for people who want to know what a podcast's about before
		downloading some episodes. Additionally, shortened audio is useful for artists trying to break out- like how 
		filmmakers have demo reels. With SoundShot, I designed keeping energy and movement found in music and sound in mind.
